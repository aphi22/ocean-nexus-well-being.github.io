*"MURAL is space for your team to collaborate visually and problem-solve faster with an easy-to-use digital canvas. No ordinary online whiteboard, MURAL has powerful facilitation features, guided methods, and the deep expertise organizations need to transform teamwork."*

# MURAL for Participant Discussion:

MURAL was used to encourage everyone to participate and feel free to express themselves in words, pictures, poems, gifs, or any form. Participants were given a pre-survey through MURAL prior to attending the workshop and were asked to use MURAL as a platform to participate in group discussions.
