## 'Problems with Well-Being and Gaps' - Interactive Discussion led by Tiff-Annie Kenny

**Is well-being a useful construct?**

- **Person 1:** *In Wales, in our study we went through every mention of wellbeing in every Welsh policy document and we found 125 different references to well-being, each of which meant something different. Even as a tiny jurisdiction that put wellbeing at the center, every policy area has different standards and two seperate wellbeing statutes. Their constructs of wellbeing are dramatically different.*
- **Person 2:** *How do we operationalize this idea of wellbeing? How do we apply it meaningfully?*
- **Person 3:** *My concern is that the concept of wellbeing might be easily co-opted by actors or organizations wishing to maintain the status quo rather than doing anything to materially change it. Some firms and organizations have made initiatives that could be considered related to wellbeing, but my concern is particularly about how to avoid co-optation.*
  - **Elaine:** *Good comments Tim -- Did you see some of the frames that put individuals and local communities in the center? We did not go into some of the extended literature but there are ways to use values based approaches that can lead to better "valuation" of these more difficult concepts.

  - **Tim:** *Yes, I think that strategy seems essential Elaine*
