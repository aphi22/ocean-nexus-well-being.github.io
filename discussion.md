# Participant Discussions

For discussions, participants were asked to use [MURAL](https://ever-rasy.github.io/oceanwellbeingworkshop.github.io/mural/) as a digital canvas to collaborate and discuss within groups. 

Prior to attending the workshop, participants were asked to complete a pre-survey through MURAL.

## Pre-Survey
