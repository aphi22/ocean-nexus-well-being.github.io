 ## **UN SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages**
 
 
It is important to acknowledge that of the 13 indicators for this SDG only one (3.4) is related to well-being, and there are only two indicators here both related to mortality rate. The goal of this workshop is to expand this thinking by justifying a more holistic approach to understanding well-being.
